## Defining and Differentiating Machine learning -- More to explore

The Definition:

>Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, >behaviors, and trends.

  Data science deals with identifying patterns in data and using it to make predictions or map relations between data points; Machine learning is a technique used by data scientists to forecast future trends using existing data and outcomes implimenting various algorithms which learn and identify data patterns among the give data points.

## History of Machine learning

Artificial intelligence started in 1950s which is all about writing algorithms that mimic human thought process. Machine learning then came to write programs which identify data patterns without explicitly being programmed. Deep learning with the discovery of neural nets is the breakthrough that drove the AI boom and also complex machine learning applications such as language processing and image classification.

Many hidden layers and hidden nodes made the field to be called as deep learning.

## The Data science process - 

1. Collect Data - From various sources such as, but not limited to:
  * Files
  * Databases
  * Webservices
  * Scraping/Crawling webpages
2. Preparing Data - Data cleansing (Removing undecirable values and data points from the data set) and Data visualistation (visualing data using plots/graphs)
